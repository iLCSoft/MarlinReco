# v01-36

* 2024-07-30 Ulrich Einhaus ([PR#136](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/136))
  Bug: PFOs were ignored if their MC PDG was not among signal or background PDGs. This is of minor effect, since by default all detector-stable charged particles are considered signal or background, but could lead to MC info leaking into reconstructed values in case of unintended usage.
  Solution: This effect now requires training mode to be ON, which is exclusive with inference mode.

* 2024-06-24 tmadlener ([PR#135](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/135))
  - Add a `ReconstructedParticleParticleIDFilterProcessor` that allows to filter `ParticleID` objects from existing `ReconstructedParticle`s.

* 2024-06-24 tmadlener ([PR#132](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/132))
  - Make the `TrueJet` processor use the `PIDHandler` to set the `ParticleIDs` for the different objects it creates. This sets the necessary metadata that is required, e.g. for the conversion to EDM4hep.

* 2024-06-19 Carl Mikael Berggren ([PR#134](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/134))
  Reduce the size of the ParticleID vector for the final fermion-antifermion pair, since
  
  for this case, there can only be one pair. This to avoid cluttering of empty collections after transition to the EDM4HEP world. At the same time, the documentation and example steerings in the examples subdirectory have been updated. mainly for the move of TrueJet_Parser from here to MarlinUtil, but also spell-checking etc.

* 2024-06-10 Ulrich Einhaus ([PR#133](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/133))
  - This adds the WWCategorisationProcessor to MarlinReco
  - It categorises each event by its WW decays channels. It provides a true category (only meaningful for true WW events) as well as two levels of reconstructed category. They are stored as event parameters.
  - This may serve as common coherent categorisation for any analyses using WW events.

* 2023-07-04 Ulrich Einhaus ([PR#118](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/118))
  Comprehensive Particle Identification Processor: First beta version of CPID.
  Extracts PID-related observables from PFOs and combines them in a training model, which can be inferred afterwards to data.
  This release contains the initial version of the Marlin processor with an example steering file, the input algorithm generic class + manager along with a library of different input algorithms, corresponding to different PID observables, as well as the training model generic class + manager along with a library of predefined models for training and inference.
  The selection of algorithms and models is handled via the processor steering file.
  The managers allow to add new modules (algorithms and models), compile and use them via the steering file, without the necessity to touch any other files.
  ComprehensivePIDProcessor.h contains a ReadMe section with an explanation of all processor steering parameters.

  - Switch from `dd4hep::long64` to `dd4hep::CellID` to be compatible with DD4hep after [AIDASoft/DD4hep#1125](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/1125)

* 2023-06-07 Bohdan Dudar ([PR#113](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/113))
  - Always use the first (before)  --> latest (now) curl in the track to get extrapolated track position at the calorimeter surface. This gives sometimes better estimate of the track position at the ECAL surface, especially for the tracks with large number of curls. Thus  new version gives better time of flight correction for the distance to the surface and thus TOF itself.
  - Minor style improvements

* 2023-06-07 Bohdan Dudar ([PR#112](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/112))
  - Switch to the helix formula without Omega: $\ell_{i} = \frac{|z_{i+1} - z_{i}|}{|\tan{\lambda_{i}}|}\sqrt{1 +\tan^2{\lambda_{i}}}$. It shows the best performance so far.
  - Other bug fixes and consistency improvements.

  - Migrated track length and  mean harmonic momentum code from `TOFEstimators` into separate `TrackLengthProcessor` to save CPU computing time. 
  - **NOTE: If you have been using these processors outside of the standard reconstruction chain you will have to update your steering files** (see iLCSoft/ILDConfig#133 for the necessary changes)

# v01-32-01

* 2021-11-05 Bohdan Dudar ([PR#96](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/96))
  - **Major upgrade of TOFEstimators with bug fixes and updates that are not backward compatible**
    - Track length calculation is significantly improved by refitting the track and iterating over the track states on each tracker hit
    - Fixed bugs with phi coordinate flip and wrong `abs()` instead of `std::abs()`
    - Output in the PIDHandler is changed to the minimal set of required three parameters for the PID (momentum, track length, TOF)
    - Input steering parameters adjusted
    - Removed TOFPlots processor. General clean up of the files and the code
    - Detailed documentation is added

* 2021-11-04 Thomas Madlener ([PR#101](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/101))

  **Thanks to Bohdan Dudar** (@dudarboh)

* 2021-11-01 Thomas Madlener ([PR#94](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/94))
  - Make the IsolatedLeptonTagging processor always produce the expected output collections, even for empty input collections, i.e. if the inputs are empty:
    - the `OutputPFOsWithoutIsoLepCollection` will simply have the same content as the `InputPandoraPFOsCollection`
    -  the `OutputIsoLeptonsCollection` will be empty. 
  - On the other hand actually missing input collections will now no longer be handled as these point to a real problem (e.g. typo in the collection name). Fixes #93

  Heavily reworked version of TrueJet
  ===========================
  
  From the outside, little has changed:
  New jet-type (6) for non-isr photon from the hard interaction.
  Does not require recoparticles (nor recomctruthlink), so also works
  on generator-output lcio-files.
  Boolean steering flag to indicate Whizard1 (GDE) or Whizard2 (LCC) input
  (false by default, i.e. input is Whizard2)
  
  Internally, heavily re-worked.
  
  - removed methods fix94 and fix_top
  - New method (stdhep_reader_bug_workaround) called if _whiz1 is true  
  - New method - photon - added to treat the new jet type 6 (M.E. photon).
  - New boolean data-members _whiz1 (steering flag),  _higgs_to_glue_glue
  and _top_event (the latter two set at run-time event by event)
  - Handle the case if no reconstructed information (generator input). 
  - In top events, define the initial colour-neutral as  the top 
  - Default collectionnames changed to the mc2020 ones.
  
  Changes and enhancemts to TrueJet_Parser and Use_TrueJet to go with new TrueJet
  =================================================================
  
  TrueJet_Parser.
  
  - added  MCPseen : LCIntExtension<MCPseen>, used to avoid
  double counting of *true* particles (decay-in-flight ...) for true-of-seen.
  
  - New methods: mcpjet, mcpicn,mcpfcn, recojet, recoicn and recofcn to 
  returns the  corresponding jet, icn or fcn number of MCPs or PFOs.
  true_partics, to return the list of all mcps in a jet (reco_particle
  already existed).
  
  Use_TrueJet:
  
  - Gracefully handle case with no recoMCTruthLink. 
  
  - Exercise the new methods in TrueJet_Parser.

* 2021-02-10 Yasser Radkhorrami ([PR#85](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/85))
  Improved the `ErrorFlow` processor:
  1.  An option added to enable/disable confusion term in the jet energy error
  2. For scaling angular uncertainties of jets, CovMat of the jet is scaled by scaling factors (as processor parameters)
  3. So far, charged PFOs used to be identified by charge, so the energy of neutral PFOs with tracks was added to photons/neutral hadrons energy. Now, neutral PFOs are classified as charged PFO, since the energy and momentum are obtained from tracks.
  4. An option added to propagate confusion term to **all** covariance matrix elements.
  
  - New processor parameters:
        -   "EnableConfusionTerm", "Enable/disable confusion term to be added to covariance matrix"
        -   "CovMatFactorPhotons", "A correction factor to be multiplied to angular uncertainties of photons"
        -   "CovMatFactorNeutralHadrons", "A correction factor to be multiplied to angular uncertainties of Neutral Hadrons"
        -   "PropagateConfusion2Mom", "Enable/disable Propagating uncertainty due to confusion to the Momentum components/All CovMat elements"

        - Combined the PFOAnalysis processor with the jet analysis power of the TrueJet/TrueJet_Parser tools to gain insight into individual jet behaviour and reconstruction.

* 2018-08-06 Erica Brondolin ([PR#54](https://github.com/ilcsoft/MarlinReco/pull/54))
  - Introduce CLICPfoSelectorAnalysis which runs on the PFO input collection and creates: a TTree with the PFO variables used in the CLICPfoSelector, cluster time vs pT graphs for each particle category and region, and PFO energy sum histos for each particle category and region
  - CLICPfoSelectorAnalysis has the possibility to detect if the PFO belongs to signal/overlay
  - CLICPfoSelectorAnalysis has the possibility to check if the track and the cluster belonging to the same PFO were produced by at least one common MCParticle

* 2018-07-18 Junping Tian ([PR#53](https://github.com/ilcsoft/MarlinReco/pull/53))

* 2018-04-18 Carl Mikael Berggren ([PR#50](https://github.com/ilcsoft/MarlinReco/pull/50))
  - improved TrueJet processor:
       - Fixed crash due to index out-of-range
       - Remove all compiler warnings except local shadow (cheked to be OK)
       -  id of initial ColourNeutrals fixed (should be a boson (W,Z,H))
       - MCParticle collection does not need to start with the beam-particles, back-tracking now also
  gracefully stops if the first entry is reached. This should allow for usage also for the DBD-250 samples, in which the initial beam-particles are missing in the MCParticle collections.
       - nitty-gritty special cases in history fixed.
       - Now also works for higgs-samples *except for h->gluon gluon*, which will need a completely different treatment fro back-track through the parton shower, as there is no quark-line to follow...

  Updates of SiTracker_dEdxProcessor:
  
  - Cleaned up unnecessary code.
  - Added runtime protection against failure of `TrackImpl::getTrackState()`.
  - Replaced `MarlinTrk::IMarlinTrack::propagate()` which was making the processor ~1000X slower than necessary with `MarlinTrk::IMarlinTrack::extrapolate()`.

  -   Added minor runtime protections.

* 2018-01-09 Strahinja Lukic ([PR#35](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/35))
  - `SiTracker_dEdxProcessor` was adapted to determine the barrel/endcap type of tracker detector by checking the layering extension, rather than the type flag as before. 
  - A bug was corrected in `SiTracker_dEdxProcessor` that caused miscalculation of total sensor thickness for some of the available dEdx estimators.

  - Add to/from type info to the relation collections
  - Fix warnings from the compiler

* 2018-02-08 Andreas Alexander Maier ([PR#33](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinReco/pull/33))
  - This package is an extension to the IsolatedLeptonFinderProcessor. The default functionality is untouched.
    - Optionally, it dresses leptons with close-by particles. By default it dresses electrons and muons with photons.
    - The algorithm starts with the highest energy lepton and adds all photons (and, optionally, electrons) in a cone of a given size around to it. As the original, it creates a collection with the dressed leptons and another collections with all remaining particles, except the ones that were dressed into the leptons.
    - All compiler warnings are fixed

S. Lukic
  - Adding SiPID package to MarlinReco. 
    For the moment it contains the processor which calculates dE/dx for 
    a silicon tracker and writes it to the lcio file.
    Primarily intended for CLICdet but generally applicable. 
    DD4hep is used to access geometry.
    CMakeLists.txt in MarlinReco was adjusted. The package is added only
    if DD4hep and MarlinTrk are found.

M.Petric
  - fix in TruthVertexFinder
 
D. Jeans
  - copy calodigi documentation into Realistic package (+ a few changes to help latex compile)

S. Lu
  - comment out 'ADD_MARLINRECO_PKG( ./Clustering/BCalReco)' for solving
    '*** Break *** segmentation violation' at the end of Marlin run.
    ToDo: To ckeck which ilcsoft package use the same resource (maybe root resource). 



# v01-16

   - fixed logic in determination of calibration by layer

M. Chera
   - fixed bug such that the processor now skips events with empty PFO collections without crashing
   

# v01-14

M. Berggren
   - Much ameliorated linking for clusters, taking back-scattering and
     decays in flight into account in a more correct way when finding
     what MCP to connect to a sim-hit.
     Work-around for the inverted meaning of the vertexIsNotEndpointOfParent
     method in Mokka. Set processor parameter  InvertedNonDestructiveInteractionLogic
     to activate the work-around (default is false)
     More consistent debugging. All levels from 0 to 9 used.

   - improved RecoMCTruthLinker
     Changed weight in hit<->mcparticle relation to the CaloHit energy (instead of the
     SimHit one). Also means the sim-hits not digitised (ie. without related CaloHit)
     are ignored. This also feeds through to the weights in the Cluster<->MCparticle
     relation, which should now be more correct: correct calibration factors applied
     for each hit.
     When doing the final relinking in problematic cases, explicitly check *only* back-scatters.
     Added MCP->cluster link for the case with the fixup of the missing truth-link for
     the LCAL in the DBD samples. Before only cluster->MCP was filled in this case.
   - Correted the true-particle to calorimeter-hit link for the case that
     the original true particle has been squeezed out by the cluster-linker,
     typically because it was created before the calorimeter, but after the
     last sensitive layer in the tracker.


  - AddClusterProperties:
     Use the PFO energy (not the cluster) when assign the PFO 4-momentum.
     Also add the sum of weights (=hit energy) to the cluster shape parameters.
     (In the DBD production, this is the same as the cluster energy, but it
     is not guaranteed to be the case).
   - Better/safer use of collection-parameters for indexing in sub-detector energy and shape-parameter arrays.
   - Different/simpler(?) calculation of Cov(4mom) in PFO.

F.Gaede 
 - changed log level for "processing event" from MESSAGE to DEBUG8
   in TPCDigiProcessor.cc
   -> use Statusmonitor instead



G.Wilson
   - added GammaGammaCandidateTruthFilter
    New processor to select those GammaGammaCandidates (fitted pairs of Pandora PFO photons) based 
    on MC information indicating actual parentage from a true pi0, eta or eta' meson decaying to gamma gamma.
    Output collections are called TrueGammaGammaPi0s etc.
    Cuts are made on the parent meson being prompt (production vertex distance < 10 cm), and the amount of the PFO 
    energy coming from the MC photon following similar criteria developed in ILDPerformance/pi0.
    This aspect will need some further investigation/tuning.


J.List
 - improve TrueJet:
 - First version that runs also over Higgs samples. No crash/obvious problem in several 1000s of events, 
   but more sophisticated checks pending. When running with full RecoMCTruthLink, estimate of of seen of true 
   energy needs fix, both on standard Whizard and Higgs samples


 M. Kurata
    - change overall structure for particle ID in LikelihoodPIDProcessor
    - change dEdx error estimation

 
M.Berggren:

    Added AddClusterProperties processor, a processor that adds cluster
    position and direction (w/uncertainties) to clusters, energy error 
    (if not already set) to clusters and 4-mom (w/ covariance)
    to neutral PFOs. Depends on a new MarlinUtil class (WeightedPoints3D),
    so for now, the processor is out-commented in CMakeLists.txt, to
    avoid problems if MarlinUtil isnot up-to-date !


G.Wilson 
  - update GammaGammaCandidateFinder
    - compute and fill ReconstructedParticle covariance matrix
  - Add GammaGammaSolutionFinder and DistilledPFOCreator processors

        - create track and cluster relations in any case as they are needed for the final recomctruth-link
	- The LCRelation Collections for TrackerHit to SimTrackerHits have been merged into a list of collections. 
	  Internally a single temporary collection of LCRelations is created.


# v01-01
      
      - RecoMCTruthLinker
        -  added mcTruthTrackLink: inverse relation from MCParticles to Tracks
           the weight will be the fraction of all sim-hits from the MCParticle
           that contributed to this track
        - changed weight definition for trackMCTruthLink:
          - weight is the fraction of all hits on the the track that have 
            contributions from this MCParticle
          - computed as sumSimHits_from_this_MCParticle/total_number_of_hits_on_track
             -> weight can be large than 1.0 (if more than one hit from an MCParticle
                would be used in a given layer (delta ray))
             -> this definition of weights is more accurate for defining the 'fake hit rate'
                as (1.-weight) in the case of many merged sim hits for a given track
         - changed steering logic, such that it can be more easily called for
           certain sub-tasks, eg. Track-MCTruth-Link only:
         - made the following output collections optional:
           trackMCTruthLink, clusterMCTruthLink, RecoMCTruthLink, calo-hit MCTruthLink, skimmed MCParticle
           -> collections won't be created if empty name specified (default)
         - removed options:
           OutputClusterRelation, OutputCalohitRelation, OutputTrackRelation
           they are now also based on name empty/not empty 
         - changed default for UseTrackerHitRelations to 'true'
            - print WARNING of set to false
           -- F.Gaede

      - LDCCaloDigi
          Implement use of LCIO calorimeter Hit step position for SDHCAL digitizer

                            due to the use of the ladders phi angle instead of it angle of inclination

	- FPCCDDigitizer: Fixed bug in helix approximation.- in previous version the intersection between particle and ladder 
                          could be rotated to the opposite side.

        - MarlinKinfit improved and new example (J.List) 

        - fixed LEPTracking for large #pad rows in TPC (S.Aplin)
          ( currently 512 pad rows are allowed - increase by
            setting the value of N32BITREG in padrow.inc )

        - dvips for documentation does not send to printer (J.Engels)

        - added simple digitizers SimpleLCalDigi and SimpleMuonDigi (by M.Thomson)

        - ...

       - improved TrackBasedPFlow (O.Wendt)
	 * example steering file for the
	   Track-Based Particle Flow processor
	 * bug fixes and improved performance
         * LEPTracking: use TrackerHit::getCovMatrix for resolution

       - make consistent use of GEAR (K.Harder, C.Lynch) 
         * TrackDigi/VTXDigi: introduce gear
         * use global GEAR B field setting instead of TPC parameters setting in:
           Analysis/CheckPlots, Pflow/TrackBasedPFlow, Pflow/Wolf, Tracking/BrahmsTracking
         * updated example gear files (Bfield)
	 * Tracking/SiliconTracking: adjustments for new
	   GEAR file format as of Mokka v06-04-p02

       - improved FullLDCTracking (A.Raspereza)
         * some bugs fixed, e.g. wrong reference point
         * detailed users manual: doc/FullLDCTracking_Manual.pdf
         * consistent use of gear::BField 
       	 * TrackDigi/TPCDigi: Modified class for digitization of the
	   TPC hits. Spatial resolutions as well as parameters tpcPixRP and
	   tpcPixZ, representing the physical pad width and time binning
	   respectively, are passed to the processor as external parameters
	   (implemented by Clare Lynch)
         * example steering file
         * introduced various fit options
         * improved performance
         * digitization of laddered VXD detectors
  
       - improved code and cmake build files (J.Engels)
         * removed unused variables (compiler warnings)
         * install target for header files
         * fortran compiler flags and libg2c
            
       - improved documentation (F.Gaede)
	 * automatic generation of API doc (doxygen)

# v00-04
   - cmake is now default build tool:  (J.Engels)
        # edit BuildSetup.cmake as needed
        mkdir build ; cd build
        cmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..
        make install
     -> creates plugin library $MarlinReco/lib/libMarlinReco.so
       

   - improved Tracking  (A.Raspereza)
       Extended version of TrackCheater, FullLDCTracking and SiliconTracking.
       The numbers of hits from different subdetectors are stored using
       TRACK:subdetectorHitNumbers. trackfit.F has been modified to
       account for curling tracks.

   -  Clustering/PhotonFinderKit/EMShowerFinder  (O.Wendt)
	  Processor to find electro-magnetic showers. 
          It is based on the KIT package and takes
	  only ECAL hits into account.	The output is a collection of
	  clusters in which the electro-magnetic shower are stored

   - TrackBasedPFlow (O.Wendt)
       + debugging and improvement of performance
       + included EMShowerFinder for improved efficiency to find
	 electromagnetic showers
