Description:
  This processor takes an input collection of ReconstructedParticle.
  The input collection is split into two, a list of isolated leptons and
  a list of everything else. The two separated lists are written as
  output collections.
  - OutputCollectionIsolatedLeptons
  - OutputCollectionWithoutIsolatedLepton

  See the example directory for some steering example.

  The selection of isolated leptons is based on the following criteria:

  1) The isolated lepton candidate is charged.

  2) Isolation requirement based on cone energy, where the cone energy
     is defined as the sum of the energy of particles which fall within
     a cone of a specific half-cone angle (CosConeAngle) of a candidate
     lepton track.  The energy of the candidate track is not added to
     the cone energy.

     The isolation selections can be performed in the following ways
     (the two methods can be combined):

     a) Rectangular cuts on the candidate track energy:
        - IsolationMinimumConeEnergy
        - IsolationMaximumConeEnergy
        and the cone energy:
        - IsolationMinimumConeEnergy
        - IsolationMaximumConeEnergy

     b) Polynomial cuts on the 2D plane of track energy vs cone energy,
        with the parameters of the cuts are defined as
        - A (IsolationPolynomialCutA)
        - B (IsolationPolynomialCutB, GeV)
        - C (IsolationPolynomialCutB, GeV^2)
        The parameters are used in the following formula:
        - Econe^2 < A*Etrk^2 + B*Etrk + C
        If the above equation holds true, the candidate passes the
        isolation requirement.

        The polynomial cut can be turned on/off using the
        UsePolynomialIsolation parameter.

     c) Jet-based isolation requirement, based on "LAL Lepton Finder"
        originally developed by Philippe Doublet in ttbar analysis.

        The selection can be turned on/off using the UseJetIsolation
        parameter.

        The key idea is to force jet clustering into the desired number
        of jets in the final state including the isolated lepton; if the
        isolated lepton becomes part of the jet, it will likely have a
        large transverse momentum relative to the jet direction,
        or have the leading energy in the jet.  An extreme example of
        the latter case is when the jet consists only of the lepton.
        In most cases, the combination of the two effects is present.
        They are parametrized using two variables which are defined
        as follows:

        Xt = Energy of PFO / Energy of jet
        Z  = pT of PFO w.r.t. jet direction / Mass of jet

        The minimum and maximum values of Xt and Z can be specified.
        - JetIsolationVetoMinimumXt
        - JetIsolationVetoMaximumXt 
        - JetIsolationVetoMinimumZ
        - JetIsolationVetoMaximumZ
        Cuts on these vairables will be applied as veto of non-isolated
        leptons, applied as the AND requirement.

        One needs to supply the jet collection name for jets which are 
        clustered before the isolated lepton finder runs.
        - JetCollection
        In general, this jet finder can be (and often should be)
        different from the jet finder in the final event selection.

        If another jet finder (such as kT algorithm) is used to reduce
        beam-related backgrounds, it is recommended to apply the jet
        finder for isolation to the set of particles without the
        beam backgrounds.

        See example/LAL_Lepton_Finder.xml for an example.

  3) Optionally, the PID requirements can be used (UsePID).
     The lepton PID employed here is a set of primitive cuts on
     the variables based on the ECAL and HCAL energy deposits.
     Two variables are used:
     - EcalToHcalFraction = EdepECAL / ( EdepECAL + EdepHCAL )
     - EnergyDepositByMomentum = ( EdepECAL + EdepHCAL ) / Momentum
     The cut values can be defined for electrons and muons individually.

  4) Optionally, the impact parameter requirements can be used via
     UseImpactParameter.  (This is useful e.g. for selecting primary
     lepton tracks coming from top quark decays.)
     Cuts can be placed on the abs(d0) and abs(z0) impact parameters
     (d0 and z0 are the same definition as in track reconstruction):
     - ImpactParameterMinD0
     - ImpactParameterMaxD0
     - ImpactParameterMinZ0
     - ImpactParameterMaxZ0
     In addition, cuts on the 3D impact parameter is also available,
     which is defined as:
     - R0 = sqrt( D0*D0 + Z0*Z0 )
     The cut parameters are:
     - ImpactParameterMin3D
     - ImpactParameterMax3D

  5) Optionally, the impact parameter significance cuts can be applied
     which can be turned on/off via UseImpactParameterSignificance.
     The variables are computed in the same way as above, divided by
     the error obtained from the track covariance matrices,
     e.g. sqrt(Cov[d0,d0]) and sqrt(Cov[z0,z0]).
     Only the diagonal errors are used.  Thus the "R0" significance
     is computed as follows:
     - R0sig = sqrt( D0sig*D0sig + Z0sig*Z0sig )

     Define the minimum and maximum cut values using the following
     parameters:
     - ImpactParameterMinD0Significance
     - ImpactParameterMaxD0Significance
     - ImpactParameterMinZ0Significance
     - ImpactParameterMaxZ0Significance
     - ImpactParameterMin3DSignificance
     - ImpactParameterMax3DSignificance
