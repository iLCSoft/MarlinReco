This directory contains example steering files for MarlinReco
package.

The directory LDC contains an example XML steering file and GEAR
XML file for the LDC concept study detector needed for MarlinReco.
For detailed information see LDC/README file.

Example steering XML file exampleVTX.xml is meant to illustrate
VertexTracking processor running only on the vertex detector hits.
When running Marlin with this steering file, LCIO file
top_vxd01.slcio is proccessed. This file contains LCIO collection
hits produced in the vertex detector.
The output file output.slcio is produced which contains also
the collection of the reconstructed tracks in the vertex detector.

Example steering XML file example_VTX_FTD.xml is used to demonstrate
the extended functionality of the VertexTracking processor.
When running Marlin with this steering file, a combined tracking
in the vertex detector and forward tracking disks is performed.
Tracks are output in Track collection, named VTXTracks, and output
lcio file, named output.slcio, is produced. When running Marlin
with example_VTX_FTD.xml steering file, the LCIO file
top_6j_500GeV_silicon.slcio is processes. It contains LCIO collections
of TrackerHits both in the vertex detector and FTD.

Example steering XML file "steer_ldctracking.xml" demonstrates
functionality of LEPTrackingProcessor, SiliconTracking and
FullLDCTracking processors. The job steered by this file
reads detector geometry description from the GEAR xml file "gear_ldc01_tracking.xml",
performs combined tracking in TPC and silicon detectors (VTX,FTD,SIT) and
produces "outputfile.slcio" file. The job runs on "ZHllX_350.slcio" file,
which is produced by Mokka (Model LDC01) and contains results of
the simulation of LDC detector response to ZH->llX events. The file
input LCIO file "ZHllX_350.slcio" contains collections
of SimCalorimeterHits and SimTrackerHits. The output file "outputfile.slcio"
contains in addition collections of TPCTracks, SiTracks and full LDCTracks.
The gear steering "gear_ldc00_tracking.xml" describes geometry
of the tracking system implemented in the Mokka model LDC00. This
steering must be used whenever you process lcio files containing
results of the Mokka program run with detector model LDC00.

Be aware of the fact that gear steerings "gear_ldc00_tracking.xml"
and "gear_ldc01_tracking.xml" describe only tracking system
within Mokka models LDC00 and LDC01. If you intend to run
full reconstruction, including calorimeter clustering and
particle flow, you have to supplement these steerings with
the description of the ECAL and HCAL.

Content of the output LCIO files can be inspected with "dumpevt" utility
from $LCIO/bin directory.
