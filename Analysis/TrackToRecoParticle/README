Description:

This is a Marlin processor for converting Track objects into
ReconstructedParticle objects.

It takes as input a collection of lcio::Track objects and writes
as output a collection of lcio::ReconstructedParticle objects.

The momentum of the particle is calculated from the helical
track parameters.  The energy is set assuming the pion mass.
The charge is set according to the curvature (omega parameter).

Below is an example of the steering file:

<!-- Convert tracks into reconstructed particles-->
<processor name="myTrackToRecoParticleConverter" type="TrackToRecoParticleConverter">
  <parameter name="InputTracks" value="MarlinTrkTracks" />
  <parameter name="OutputPFOCollection" value="RecoParticlesFrom" />
</processor>
