## new feature for supporting application without using impact parameters 01/09/2019
for applications that don't want to use impact parameters, set the steering parameter "UseIP" to "false" and use the weight files trained in the same case; example steering file can be found in "example/isolep_woIP_woYoke.xml"


## change for new ILD samples 07/18/2018
due to potential problem in muon reconstruction with associated hits in Yoke, added a option in processor which doesn't make use of energy deposited in Yoke. It has been tested that the performance without using Yoke for isolated muon tagging should be fine for most analyses. Before the potential problem resolved, it is recommended to use this new option (steered by "UseYokeForMuonID") with default value. The corresponding new weight file (only needed for muon) is also provided under dir "weights" (with tag "woYoke").


### change for the new ILD samples 07/06/2018
1.) since the interaction point is smeared, the impact parameters for every track should be redefined with respect to primary vertex position. It is now fixed. The fixed processor should be backward compatible (can be used without any change for DBD samples as well). See more details in recent reports at ILD Soft & Ana Meeting

2.) weights have been re-trained using new samples yyxylv (yyxyev) as signal and yyxyyx (including yycyyc, yycyyu, yyuyyc and yyuyyu) as background. Available now are for ILD_l5_o1_v02. Same weights can be used in most studies for ILD_s5_o1_v02 as well. Re-trained weigts for ILD_s5_o1_v02 will be provided later. 

3.) upon request, more weights would be available for 4-fermion processes, or more optimised pre-cuts for MVA might be provided. 



#a minimum instruction to use
1.) see steering in example/isolep.xml
2.) make sure to set the correct links to weights trained by MVA
3.) several weights trained for different analyses are available, but the dependence shall be rather weak;
    the existing ones are insed weights/ (released together with this package)
4.) the default processor "IsolatedLeptonProcessor" selects one isoalted lepton with highest tagging;
    one can just change the flag in steering "isSelectingOneIsoLep" to select all possible ones
5.) output collection "ISOLeptons", associated by parameter "ISOLepTagging" which can be further used to
    apply cut, and "ISOLepType" which is 13 for muon, and is 11 for electron.
