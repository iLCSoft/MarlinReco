    /** Get all subtracks of the Track.
    Returns a vector of the subTracks of the main track that is passed as an argument.

    The main purpose of this function is to capture all hits of the track.
    This requires iteration over the subTracks as the main Track stores hits only
    of the first half turn due to the our fit procedure.

    The first subTrack in the returned vector is always main Track itself, which
    containes VXD, SIT and TPC tracker hits for the first half turn.

    Then additional subTracks are added which contain hits for additional track revolutions if such exist.

    If nTPCHits \f$ \pm  1\f$ = nHits of SubTrack0 then assume subTrack0 stores TPC hits.
    This would mean that VXD and SIT subTrack is not stored!
    So we need skip *only first* subtrack: initial subTrack0 with TPC hits which we have anyhow added with the main Track
    Else if nTPCHits \f$ \pm  1\f$ = nHits of SubTrack1 assume subTrack1 stores TPC hits
    This would mean that subTrack0 stores VXD and SIT hits.
    So we need to *skip both* subtracks VXD+SIT and 1st TPC half-turn subTracks which we have anyhow added with the main Track

    Note: We consider deviations for \f$\pm 1\f$ hit may happen because of the
    SET and only God knows what other reasons...

    but I didn't find a better way to collect subTracks.
