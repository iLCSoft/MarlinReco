 TrueJet: A Marlin processor to group particles into jets, using
true information.

Brief description:

  Use this Marlin processor to create collections and navigators
to find jets actually coming from separate initial systems. 
Both true, seen, and true-of-seen jet-energies are accessible.
The correct total energy can be calculated. Correct di-jet
pairings giving W&Z are provided. Jet-flavour is indicated.
Inner brems-strahlung and gluon induced jets are flagged.
Particles from overlaid gamma-gamma to hadrons are identified.

To use the the output from the processor in further analysis,
it is suggested to use the helper-class TrueJet_Parser.

The only processor-parameters used are collection names for
input (mcparticles(skimmed), pfos, and the mc-reco link),
and output. The defaults should work when running on DBD DSTs,
so normally no parameters are needed to be specified.

See the examples folder for suggested steering-files. Play with the
Verbosity level. Put to MESSAGE or WARNING to make it almost shut up.

================================================================
Detailed Description:

  The processor uses the skimmed MCParticle collection, and the
RecOMCTruthLink navigator as input. It recreates the Pythia event
record from the MCParticles, correct in-consistencies (both those 
already present in  the input stdhep file and those created by
simulation). It identifies the _initial_ and _final_ colour-neutral
systems, meaning those at the beginning and end of the parton-shower,
respectively. It identifies the decay-products of these systems and
the particles giving rise to them. In each such system, the final
products are assigned to one of two jets, by looking at the angle to
either of the two particles creating the colour-neutral system.
All decay-products - also those created in simulation - of the
primary hadrons are assigned to the same jet as their ancestor.
The jet-identity is also propagated backwards through the parton-
shower, until either the initial, hard particles from the matrix-
element are reached, or it is found that the particles came from
a radiated gluon or IVB. In the process, inner-bremstrahlung photons
are also found, and added to the jet of the particle that radiated
them.

The  _final_ colour-neutral systems always give rise to two jets.
This is also true if the colour-neutral system is a "cluster"
ie. a bound state of initial quarks (normally the  colour-neutral 
system is a "string" ie. a system of two quarks and a chain of gluons).
Usually, a "cluster" materializes to a single hadron, so one of the
two jets will be _empty_. However, both jets will be present earlier
in the parton-shower.

The _initial_ colour-neutral system  might make more than two jets, 
due to gluon radiation. In the this case, TrueJet keeps track of 
which jets ultimately came from a given _initial_ colour-neutral system. 
The _initial_  colour-neutral system is the one that is expected to come 
from a single IVB-fermion-antifermion vertex in the initial hard process.

The same logic also works for leptons: They, too, are grouped together
two-by-two into groups associated with the same initial boson.

ISR photons are assigned to separate (un-grouped) jets.

All post-partonshower MCParticles that were not assigned to
any jet by this process are from overlaid gammagamma->hadrons
events, and are grouped together into one single jet.

       MCTruthRecoLink
should also be in the list, but they would be in any useful DST-output anyhow....

Contents of the output collections:

  TrueJets (ReconstructedParticle):

   getEnergy, getMass, getMomentum, getCharge returns those quantities, calculated from the values
    of all PFOs connected to the true jet.
   getParticles returns the list of all PFOs in the jet.
   getParticleIDs()[0]->getType returns the jet type as:
       1  : jet from string
       2  : jet is lepton
       3  : jet from cluster
       4  : jet is ISR
       5  : jet is overlay
      if the jet came from a quark from gluon-splitting, [(jet radiating the gluon)+1]*100 is
      added to the type.
   getParticleIDs()[0]->getPDG() returns the jet flavour as the PDG of the
    elemeton (quark/lepton/photon) it is associated to.

   No other information is filled.

  FinalColourNeutrals (ReconstructedParticle):

   getEnergy, getMass, getMomentum,  returns those quantities, as given by the values
    of the string, or the particle produced by the cluster, or as the sum of the two
    leptons from the initial boson, or as the sum of true energies of all stable particles
    (for jet type 1,3,2,5), or simply as the true value of each ISR photon (type 4)
   getParticles returns the TrueJets connected to the system (always two, except for ISR)

   getParticleIDs()[0]->getType returns the  Colour Neutral type as:
       1  : c.n. is string
       2  : c.n. is lepton-pair
       3  : c.n. is cluster
       4  : c.n. is single ISR
   getParticleIDs()[1:2]->getType is the same as the type of jet 1:2 emerging from the
     Colour Neutral system.

   getParticleIDs()[0:2]->getPDG returns the  Colour Neutral PDG as:
       0 : PDG of the system itself (92=string, 91=cluster, 22=ISR, any lepton PDG=lepton pair)
       1 : PDG of first elementon (quark, lepton or photon)
       2 : PDG of second elementon (quark or  lepton)

    No other information is filled.

  InitialColourNeutrals (ReconstructedParticle):

   getEnergy, getMass, getMomentum, returns those quantities, as given by the values
    of the CMcluster, or the particle produced by the boson, in case there was no CMCluster
    (sometimes happens for quarks, almost always for leptons)
   getParticles returns the TrueJets connected to the system (at least two, possibly more
    if there was hard gluon radiation or (top) quark-decay during the parton shower)

   getParticleIDs()[0]->getType returns the Colour Neutral type as:
       1,3  : c.n. is hadronic
       2    : c.n. lepton-pair
   getParticleIDs()[1:n]->getType is the same as the type of jet 1:n emerging from the
     Colour Neutral system.
   
   getParticleIDs()[0:n]->getPDG returns the  Colour Neutral PDG as:
       0   : PDG of the boson (23=Z, 24=W, ... )
       1:n : PDG of elementon (quark, lepton) 1:n

    No other information is filled.
 
Navigators:

  TrueJetPFOLink              TrueJet -> all PFO of jet
  TrueJetMCParticleLink       TrueJet -> all MCParticles of jet
  FinalElementonLink          TrueJet -> the MCParticle that is the Final elemeton (quark/lepton/photon) of the jet 
  InitialElementonLink        TrueJet -> the MCParticle that is the Initial elemeton (quark/lepton/photon) of the jet 
  FinalColourNeutralLink      TrueJet -> FinalColourNeutrals of the jet
  InitialColourNeutralLink    TrueJet -> InitialColourNeutrals of the jet

To make this clear:
If reltjmcp is created by
    tjmcplcol  = evt->getCollection(  _trueJetMCParticleLink );
    reltjmcp = new LCRelationNavigator( tjmcplcol );
then

 reltjmcp->getRelatedToObjects( aTrueJet )
                     ^^ 

returns the list of mcparticles in jet aTrueJet, while

 reltjmcp->getRelatedFromObjects( anMCparticle )
                     ^^^^

returns the jet anMCparticle belongs to (It is in principle a list, but off course
it only contains one element!)

Differently put, the order of the elements in the table is the same as the order of
the arguments of the addRelation method of an LCRelationNavigator.

Except for TrueJetMCParticle, the weight of the relation has no particular meaning.
In TrueJetMCParticle the meaning of the weight (as from www =  reltjmcp->getRelatedToWeights(  aTrueJet ) )
is:

  1   : stable particle from generator, or decayed particle where the sum of 4-mom of the daughters is 
        different from the 4-mom of the particle (which indicates that Mokka has modified the particle
        before decay)  
 -1   : generator inner brems photon.

  11  : generator decayed particle.
  0   : created in simulation, or generator particle where the parent has been modified before decay,
        so that the 4-mom is inconsistent.

Hence, adding all MCP:s related with any jets of types 1,2 or 3 with |weight| == 1 gives the total
4-mom of the hard reaction. Also adding jets of type 4 adds the ISR to the sum and finally
including type 5 jets also include the overlay events.
