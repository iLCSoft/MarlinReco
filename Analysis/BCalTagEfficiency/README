This processor simulates the expected BeamCal response 
to single high energetic electrons, positrons and photons 
above the energy density from pair background.

It currently takes the MCParticlesSkimmed, tracks them to the BeamCal,
looks up the local background energy density and calculates the 
corresponding efficiency. 

In addition, the response of the BCal to the incomming track is 
*simulated*, using a parametrised resolution, depending on both the
in-coming particle's energy, and the beam-background density
expected at the point the particle hits the BCal. 

A new collection  of ReconstructedParticles is then created either with: 
- all e/gamma reaching the BCAL  (detectAll == 1)
- those passing passing a random number based acceptance-rejection 
  procedure                      (detectAll == 0)
There is also a Cluster collection created, which contains 
clusters consistent with the corresponding ReconstructedParticle,
and LCRelation collection relating the ReconstructedParticle to
its parent MCParticle.

The efficiency for each particle can be accessed via
ReconstructedParticle::getGoodnessOfPID()

In addition, a root tree is written out for detailed studies.
