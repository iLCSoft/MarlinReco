GammaGammaCandidateFinder Processor

Purpose: Assemble a collection of ReconstructedParticles consisting of pairs of photons consistent with known 
         particles which can decay to two photons, including 
         pi0 -> gamma gamma, eta0 -> gamma gamma, etaprime(958)0 -> gamma gamma.

Note that the same photon will often be a constituent of more than one GammaGammaCandidate. 
The "photon matching" problem of assigning individual photons uniquely to at most one GammaGammaParticle 
or similar composite particle is to be treated in a separate processor after the creation of these GammaGammaCandidates.

trunk v>=5052
Include mass-constrained fit (and MarlinKinfit dependency). 
Fit probability currently stored in GoodnessOfPID, and gamma-gamma 4-vector is now fitted.
Implementation still needs work on handling covariance matrix from input - and covariance matrix on output.

trunk v5021 
Currently the algorithm does not do any mass-constrained fitting, but this is one of the main reasons for 
this processor, and the eventual GammaGammaCandidate collections will be mass-constrained.
