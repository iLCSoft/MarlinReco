This directory contains an example XML steering file and GEAR XML file for the LDC concept study detector needed for MarlinReco;

steer_ldc.xml

gear_ldc.xml

It also contains an example GNUmakefile which can be used in to build MarlinReco under the DESY Linux 5 computing environment. This would need to be modified for other computing environments.

GNUmakefile_desy

It also contains an example LCIO file containing 5 single muon events generated with Mokka model D12scint.

muon.lcio

The above four files must be copied to your $MARLIN directory.
