GammaGammaSolutionFinder Processor

Purpose: Assemble a collection of ReconstructedParticles consisting of pairs of photons fitted to known
         particles which can decay to two photons, including
         pi0 -> gamma gamma, eta0 -> gamma gamma, etaprime(958)0 -> gamma gamma, and which represent
         a potential solution of the di-photon assignment problem in the event where no constituent photon is
         used more than once.

Method:  Read in candidates potentially from the following three collections:
         1. GammaGammaCandidatePi0s
         2. GammaGammaCandidateEtas
         3. GammaGammaCandidateEtaPrimes
         and select a "solution" set of GammaGammaCandidates from the 3 collections that
         does not double count any constituent photon.
         The output collection is a GammaGammaSolution collection of ReconstructedParticles.

Solution Finding Algorithms:
         Current Default = Algorithm 2, namely.
         Given n photons and m GammaGammaCandidates,
         the current implementation essentially does an exhaustive search of all possible
         matchings in the graph with n vertices (photons) and m edges (GammaGammaCandidates).
         The chosen matching with r GammaGammaCandidates is the solution amongst those
         with the largest possible value of r (at most n/2) which has the lowest global fit chi-squared.
         Only solutions containing pi0s and etas are considered for the "best solution".
         Solutions are required to use each photon at most once.
         The algorithm is highly factorial and there is some CPU timing monitoring included.
         In cases where the expected solution time based on an estimate of the number of combinations that will need
         to be explored is large (controlled by MaxCombinationsCut steering parameter) the solution is chosen as the "greedy solution".

         Solution Finding Algorithm 1 (Greedy ie fast solution)
         Form sorted list of candidates. Sort by pi0, eta, etaprime. Then within each type sort by fit probability.
         First candidate in sorted list is highest probability pi0, last candidate is lowest probability etaprime.
         Then loop through candidates in sorted order and assign candidates to solution if both photons in the candidate have not yet
         been assigned to the solution.

The GammaGammaSolution collection will then be used in a downstream processor to create an updated PFO collection containing
the ReconstructedParticles of the GammaGammaSolution collection and the original PandoraPFOs that
are NOT the photon constituent ReconstructedParticles of the GammaGammaSolution collection.
This updated PFO collection, provisionally named DistilledPFOs, can be used as a replacement
for PandoraPFOs in jet energy reconstruction.
